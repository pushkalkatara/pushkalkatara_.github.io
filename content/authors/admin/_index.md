Hi there! I am excited about building intelligent robots which can see, reason, talk and act like humans. I am currently a second year Master's student at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) working with Prof. [Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) on 3D Perception and Robotics.

Prior to joining CMU, I was working with Prof. [Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/publications.html), IIIT-Hyderabad on self-supervised control generation for image-based visual navigation. I also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Clutterbot](https://www.clutterbot.com/) building perception and navigation system for home robots.

In my undergrad, I contributed to [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/) through the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6028761103335424) working under guidance of [Prof. Jose Maria Canas Plaza](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/) building finite-state automata library. I also lead the software team at [SRMAUV](https://srmauvsoftware.github.io/) building autonomous underwater vehicles.

Apart from work, I love to go on hikes, listening to music and playing musical instruments. Feel free to connect with me at pkatara@andrew.cmu.edu.
